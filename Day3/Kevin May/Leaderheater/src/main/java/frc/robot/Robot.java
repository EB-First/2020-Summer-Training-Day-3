/**
FEEDBACK
Indexer Subsystem:
- you didn't need to restate the variable type CANSparkMax for rightMotor and 
  leftMotor (lines 26 and 27) - doing this again creates two new variables with identical names,
  meaning there are two unused variables called rightMotor and leftMotor
- both the left and right motors should be moving for moveUp and moveDown -
  the ball might make it with just one motor going, but the indexer
  wouldn't be that effective at its job
  ^ also, keep in mind, the two motors would always spin in opposite directions
  
Indexer Command:
- it looks like you're missing a command for the subsystem, let me know if you need help

RobotContainer:
- don't forget to create objects for the commands and subsystems! (see line 24 for an example)
- yes, the button configurations were understandable XD , but the whenPressed() method 
  should take in a new command, not a method, e.g. button.whenPressed(new Command);
  ^I think you may have been confused because you don't have a Command 
  - ^ also, "whenHeld" doesn't really mean anything by itself so your if statements won't work as you want them to
    I love that you tried imperative style programming, but you might want to check out the Day 3 slides 
    about Button class (check out button.whenHeld()) again
    
it looks like you're getting how command based programming works, and there's just a few things to brush up!
